<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

<!-- header image of project -->

### Project Description

The world we live in today is a world of big data and people have trouble finding meaningful patterns within the expanse of information we mine, collect and store. Therefore, as a data driven developer, I have taken over the role of implementing a real-world data driven web application using a Solar System API. Within the web application I utilised Charts.js, implemented my own unique form of data visualisation which relates to the theme of the data set and used REACT to construct my front end.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Axios](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/)

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. For the conceptual process Pinterest was my best friend. I used this app to save all my ideas and explorations around specific UI Designs. I also watched YouTube videos of people creating various dashboards in javascript.

### Ideation

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* API End Point: link Here 
* `Plugin` for this.
* ETC.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* How to implement Charts.js was exciting once I got it right although it did take me a while
* I enjoyed searching for an API, there were so many to choose from and exploring various wireframes
* I also enjoyed implementing my UI Element as well as choosing an overall theme for the web application

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* I struggled to work between two laptops, I struggled to clone the repositories 
* Regularly had bugs
* The functionality of this project was very time consuming and I had to seek help in order to see if my functions were on the right track
* Specifically adding my time line on the Dashboard, as I had to add a substring in order to view just the year of the data which I eventually found through Stack overflow



#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Gif
* I added a gif on my Dashboard, Comparison and Time line page as my icon for the web application. Through so much trial and error I eventually figured out that it was actually simple, I just had to add the gif to the css and style it from there. 

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* The styling of my graphs could be much better! I could have made it a bit more visually appealing and spend more time on it and I started styling them too late.
* There could be more features in the web application, as many of the pages feel unfinished although I just tried to keep them simple, there could have been a bit more exploration to that aspect.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
