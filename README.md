<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

<!-- header image of project -->

### Project Description

The world we live in today is a world of big data and people have trouble finding meaningful patterns within the expanse of information we mine, collect and store. Therefore, as a data driven developer, I have taken over the role of implementing a real-world data driven web application using a Solar System API. Within the web application I utilised Charts.js, implemented my own unique form of data visualisation which relates to the theme of the data set and used REACT to construct my front end.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Axios](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/rest/bodies/)

<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->
## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->
![image2](https://github.com/anchenayres/medical_term2/blob/main/src/Images/mockup1.png)

### See all the available appointments in the appointments page! 

Here you are able to create an appointment, delete an appointment and update an appointment.

### Feature 2

Description of Feature

### Feature 3

Here you are able to see see all the available doctors which you can edit, update and delete at any time. It is a very functional and clean design for users.

![image4](https://github.com/anchenayres/medical_term2/blob/main/src/Images/mockup3.png)

Here you are able to see see all the receptionists which you can edit, update and delete at any time. Only the head receptionist which is logged in is able to edit this database.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. For the conceptual process Pinterest was my best friend. I used this app to save all my ideas and explorations around specific UI Designs. I also watched YouTube videos of people creating various dashboards in javascript.

### Ideation

### Wireframes

### Custom UI

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* ETC.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Learning the basics of PHP, backend development and SQL.
* Implementing the caps lock function which creates an alert when a user accidentally had their caps lock on while logging in their password
* Implementing the toggle between see and unsee password for the login page

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* I struggled to work between a laptop and desktop because of data not showing
* Regularly had bugs
* The functionality of this project was very time consuming and I had to seek help in order to see if my functions were on the right track

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Implementing the caps lock function which creates an alert when a user accidentally had their caps lock on while logging in their password
* Implementing the toggle between see and unsee password for the login page

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* I would focus on my time management and spreading out my work load throughout the term instead of stressing about functionalities not working as they should last minute
* The imagery was unable to load on all the pages all though my functionality looks correct I was unable to successfuly load an image which was selected by the user 

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
## Final Outcome
